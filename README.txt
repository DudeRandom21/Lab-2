Lab/Assignment 2 for SEG2105

Frank if you could add a folder and the files for your Design 3 it would be greatly appreciated.

Sorry I didn't check git last week. Thanks for making the git Jon, I can upload it tomorrow during the lab

Hey I finished the test suite, I'm gonna add generics a little later today to make it easier to switch between the different designs. Out to lunch now but you can reach me by email on my personal email if need be.

What's your personal email? I'm going to eat lunch too then finish part 2 afterwards. You're right about the testing, it's test the separate methods of each design then compare those designs.

Alright so I finished Part 2 and put it in that Part2 folder, but I don't know how to delete those old java files. What parts for the testing do you want help with?
