Lab/Assignment 2 for SEG2105

Frank if you could add a folder and the files for your Design 3 it would be greatly appreciated.

Sorry I didn't check git last week. Thanks for making the git Jon, I can upload it tomorrow during the lab

Hey take a look at how I modified the test file in root directory, that's how I was thinking we could set up the tests.
I'm gonna do the methodes in order if you have some you wanna start on just post them up here I'm currently working on getX and getY.
