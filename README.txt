Lab/Assignment 2 for SEG2105

Frank if you could add a folder and the files for your Design 3 it would be greatly appreciated.

Sorry I didn't check git last week. Thanks for making the git Jon, I can upload it tomorrow during the lab

Hey I finished the test suite, I'm gonna add generics a little later today to make it easier to switch between the different designs. Out to lunch now but you can reach me by email on my personal email if need be.
