Lab/Assignment 2 for SEG2105

Frank if you could add a folder and the files for your Design 3 it would be greatly appreciated.

Sorry I didn't check git last week. Thanks for making the git Jon, I can upload it tomorrow during the lab

Hey I finished the test suite, I'm gonna add generics a little later today to make it easier to switch between the different designs. Out to lunch now but you can reach me by email on my personal email if need be.

What's your personal email? I'm going to eat lunch too then finish part 2 afterwards. You're right about the testing, it's test the separate methods of each design then compare those designs.

Alright so I finished Part 2 and put it in that Part2 folder, but I don't know how to delete those old java files. What parts for the testing do you want help with?

Honestly I think I finished the test (maybe?). I'm just unsure it's the median (and max and min) of what that it is we're testing, you can look on the assignment forum I just posed a question cause I don't know but if you give me a minute I can push up a working version of what I think the test are supposed to be doing.

Ok nevermind my up to date version of the test file is already up on github
